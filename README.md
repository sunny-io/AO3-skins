Site skin and work skin particles for AO3

Any CSS I write for my own use in AO3 ends up here.
Use it in your own work or site skins, as you see fit.

Copy&Paste into the respective skin edit window in AO3.
AO3 removes all comments and selectors it doesn't support on save. 

Untested on android, windows and linux.

List of particles:

1) Stop Display Gremlins
2) Nifty display of text messages in AO3 works (coming soon)
